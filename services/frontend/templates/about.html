        <h3>That's me</h3>
        <p>My name is Philipp, I am 28 years old and currently live in Frankfurt am Main. I was born and raised in Southern Germany, which is certainly the most beautiful area in the country with the most delicious food.</p>
        
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>This is an area that I have to update regularly, as my interests are always changing. At the moment I am very interested in music, especially the guitar. I own an Ibanez AW54OPN. Songs I play at the moment are for example river flows in you (Yiruma), slow cheetah (RHCP), i took a pill in ibiza (Mike Posner), let her go (Passenger), perfect (Ed Sheeran), wish you were (Pink Floyd). I'm also a passionate cook, like to go running, keep in shape, am interested in stocks and investments, and enjoy working on side projects in my spare time.</p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>After graduating from high school, I began my educational journey by studying international management at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. I then went on to get my master's degree in economics at the University of Ulm, majoring in finance and computer science. I particularly enjoyed my experiences abroad in Mexico, Malaysia and China. I fell in love with Shanghai, the culture, the people and all the little dumplings.</p>
        
        <h3>Work experience</h3>
        <p>My first major work experience was in the project management and logistics department for <a class="blue-url" href="https://www.bbraun.de/de.html" target="_blank"><strong>B. Braun</strong></a>, which is a German healthcare company. I quickly realized my enthusiasm for numbers, patterns and models and wanted to gain more experience in the financial sector. In the following years, I worked at <a class="blue-url" href="https://careers.allianz.com/en_EN/explore-allianz/allianz-global-business-lines/allianz-technology.html" target="_blank"><strong>Allianz Technology SE</strong></a> in the financial department and at <a class="blue-url" href="https://www.allianzgi.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Allianz Global Investors</strong></a> in a team that's best described as being the interface between portfolio management and retirement products. After graduating I decided to combine my roots in the asset management and finance sector with my enthusiasm for Python, databases and machine learning. Currently I am employed as an Analytics Trainee in the <a class="blue-url" href="https://www.ing.jobs/germany/graduates-students/international-talent-programme.htm" target="_blank"><strong>International Talent Programme</strong></a> at <a class="blue-url" href="https://www.ing.de/" target="_blank"><strong>ING Germany</strong></a>. For me, the trainee program is the perfect career start, as working in different departments gives me the best possible overview of data science within the banking sector.</p>
